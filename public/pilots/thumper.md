Born to the diaspora, on a world whose present government could be summed up simply as "Military Junta," Tristn served as a combat medic in his homeworld's armed forces, and was notable for his cool temperament and steady hands.

He was not at all happy with his life; however, he was also never in a position to change its direction - not with his resources.

Fortunately, that's when Union found him.
