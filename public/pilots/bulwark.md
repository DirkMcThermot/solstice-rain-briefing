Mischa "Bulwark" Kovalsky (he/him) was born on an Armory controlled world and spent most of his life working in the scrapyards. His ability to keep the scrap crew organized and on task earned him a coveted foreman position. But Mischa grew increasingly disgusted by Armory's attitude towards workers, whom they treated as disposable tools. This came to a head during a crucial assignment when Mischa ordered his crew to leave valuable material behind in order to protect their safety. Mischa was stripped of his position, and when he decided to join the pilots academy in order to get away from Armory control, his superiors were glad to have the rabble rouser off their hands.
