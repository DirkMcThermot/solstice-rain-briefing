**Backstory**: Zara was born into slavery under the rule of Emir Julian Khan, who forced her to fight in his blood games as a gladiator. She quickly gained fame and popularity for her skill with swords and her fearless attitude. She secretly joined the Suldani Independence Front (SIF), a rebel group that opposed the Emir’s tyranny and sought to liberate Suldan from his grasp. She used her influence as a gladiator to smuggle weapons and information to the SIF, and participated in several raids and sabotage missions against the Emir’s forces. When the revolution finally broke out, she joined her fellow gladiators and slaves to storm the Emir’s palace and overthrow him. After the Emir was deposed and exiled to the badlands, Zara decided to enlist in the Union Navy, hoping to use her skills and experience to help other oppressed worlds. She still harbors a deep hatred for the Emir and his loyalists, and vows to kill him if she ever gets the chance.

She is also compassionate and generous, caring for her friends and allies, and helping those in need. She enjoys fighting and challenges, especially against worthy opponents. She is not afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believes in. She has a sense of humor and likes to joke around with her comrades. She is also a bit of a romantic idealist. She is loyal to the Union Navy and respects its ideals, but she also retains some of her rebel spirit and does not always follow orders blindly. She is proud of her Suldani heritage and culture, and often incorporates elements of it into her mech design and combat style.
