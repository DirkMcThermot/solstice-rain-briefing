Dalton Burke (he/him) is no stranger to conflict. Hailing from a star system just beyond the periphery of Union's core territories, his earliest memories are colored by the bitter interplanetary war that had raged for generations between his home world and its stellar neighbor. As soon as he came of age, Dalton joined the military, quickly displaying an aptitude for marksmanship and the ability to persevere through harrowing odds. A decade in the service saw Dalton survive combat across multiple fronts, graduating from infantryman to scout sniper as the war intensified. Only when a Union peacekeeping force intervened on behalf of his world did the conflict come to a swift end, along with the only life Dalton had ever known. Left suddenly adrift in peacetime, Dalton saw in the galactic hegemony an enticing opportunity he couldn't refuse. He was extended an offer to join the ranks of the Union Navy, and his skills and experience made him a natural candidate for the pilot academy. 

Generally stoic and reserved, Dalton is a fierce egalitarian and a committed revolutionary who has bought wholesale into ThirdComm's vision of a better future for all humanity. He intends to do his part in bringing that dream to fruition...by any means necessary.
