**Physical Description**: Dalton is a lean, muscular man of above average height. He has cool gray eyes and dark brown hair that he keeps shaved close to his scalp in a tight military buzz cut. His beard is similarly short and neatly-trimmed, kept to the length of stubble. He bears a multitude of scars across his body that speak to his extensive combat experience: a record of various lacerations, burns, and bullet wounds from nearly a decade of constant warfare on his home planet. Chief among them is a long scar that begins above his right eyebrow and cuts across the right side of his head. Dalton has two tattoos, one on each of his forearms: a golden sunburst wreathed in stalks of grain, and a fierce-looking lammergeier in flight. Off-duty, Dalton can usually be found wearing a neat naval combat uniform or a form-fitting undersuit, of the type usually worn beneath a pilot’s hardsuit. He tends to wear a sidearm at his waist wherever he is permitted to do so.

**Background**: Dalton Burke is no stranger to conflict. Hailing from a star system just beyond the periphery of Union's core territories, his earliest memories are colored by the bitter interplanetary war that had raged for generations between his home world and its stellar neighbor. As soon as he came of age Dalton joined the military, quickly displaying an aptitude for marksmanship and the ability to persevere through harrowing odds. A decade in the service saw Dalton survive combat across multiple fronts, graduating from infantryman to scout sniper as the war intensified. 
Only when a Union peacekeeping force intervened on behalf of his world did the conflict come to a swift end, along with the only life Dalton had ever known. Left suddenly adrift in peacetime, Dalton saw in the galactic hegemony an enticing opportunity he couldn't refuse. He was extended an offer to join the ranks of the Union Navy, and his skills and experience made him a natural candidate for the pilot academy. 

Generally stoic and reserved, Dalton is a fierce egalitarian and a committed revolutionary who has bought wholesale into the Third Committee's vision of a better future for all humanity. He intends to do his part in bringing that dream to fruition...by any means necessary.
