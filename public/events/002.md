# The Next Day
- Early in the morning, 1st. Lt. Kim gave CF their next mission briefing via omnihook. They were to go to a nearby comms jamming transmitter and upload a virus coded by Rio which would take down the whole network across the city. This is vital due to the LSAâ€™s upcoming counterattack against the Sovereignty, as well as the rescue of Farris and Bannerjee.
- With their new gear and systems fully prepared, and chassis good as new, CF departed FOB Saber.

# Clear the Air
- At the transmitter site, CF faced off against a Sovereignty unit containing highly specialized frames, including an ace, a demolisher, and an assassin.
- The assassin, despite its clearly elite skills, was eliminated almost entirely in one shot by Shrike, but it was Kid Fritz' turret drone that finished the job! *"You stole my kill, dude!"*
- As Druzhina struggled to land any shots or ferrous lashes on the airborne ace due to its high agility and barrel roll maneuver, he instead focused attention on the highly-annoying hacker of a witch-class frame, cleaving it with his now-smaller, but still great, sword.
- Columbia continued the job where Druzhina left off, swatting the ace like a housefly despite being under the effects of a blinding effect from the witch.
- All the while, Bulwark piloted Collective Bargain directly down the middle lane of the area, practically daring the demolisher with its massive kinetic hammer to approach. And yet, two failed hammer swings later, Bulwark emerged untouched as the demolisher was destroyed by another supportive shot from Shrike!
- With excellent teamwork in capturing and controlling the vicinity of the transmitters, the squad was able to successfully get the virus uploaded while also capturing another Sovereignty pilot from a mirage-class frame.
