# Condition 1 - Azure
- A routine day aboard the *Rio Grande* was interrupted by **Rio** (the shipboard NHP) issuing an alert for all forces to prepare for deployment to Cressidium.
- In the briefing, **1st Lt. Kim** said that Vestan Sovereignty mechs are attacking the city of Nov Elysia, and **Ambassador Bannerjee** and **Captain Farris** are stranded. Strangely, comms are down.
- Mech squads were loaded in dropships for delivery to FOB Saber, an LSA base in Nov Elysia.

# It's Not the Fall that Kills You...
- During the descent, the ship ferrying Charlie Foxtrot squadron was struck by a powerful beam of light from the ground, causing it to crash. The origin of the beam is unknown at this time.
- CF’s pilots and mechs survived without significant damage, but were quickly attacked by Sovereignty forces.
- Fortunately, the squad was able to hold out after several close calls. They have performed light repairs and are ready to move out.

# On the Move in a Military Manner
- As CF made their way through the empty city streets, they came upon a broken-down bus of civilians, with LSA soldiers trying to get it moving again. After CF made it clear that they served Union, the LSA troops requested help from them.
- Their squad had been part of a larger group escorting civilians to emergency shelters, but became cut off in an ambush. The bus then broke down and left them stranded in the middle of the downtown area.
- CF naturally did what they could to help out, and were able to repair the bus and begin providing an escort thanks to their abilities to scavenge for the right parts, perform the repairs, and then scout a route forward.

# Look Both Ways
- A short while later, they came across a Sovereignty squad lying in wait for an ambush! CF had to get the bus safely through the battlefield and out of harm’s way ASAP.
- Fortunately, they were successful, with the bus itself sustaining only negligible impacts. Excellent work!

# Broken Sky
- After making it to a clear main road, the LSA troops and civilians went their separate way to the nearest emergency shelter, with a young girl leaving a stuffed toy rabbit with the squad for good luck.
- After some light repairs, CF went back on the move, eventually coming across a train depot housing a unit of Sovereignty mechs. One of them was a rainmaker-class frame loaded up with missiles, and it shot down a Union dropship as it flew overhead.
- This missile battery was not only in the squad’s way, but also interfering with future landings in the area.

# Downpour
- CF engaged the enemy from multiple angles, utilizing a side route provided by an LSA trooper from earlier.
- The skirmish proved to be a challenging one for the squad. Oathkeeper was destroyed, and the others weren’t looking so good either.
- Luckily, the lancers were able to turn things around rather quickly after that, with Kid Fritz utilizing his hacking skills to their fullest potential against the apparent leader of this Sovereignty squad, an elite commander in a sentinel-class frame. The sentinel could barely deal with the reactor stress it was taking, and a meltdown became imminent.
- Shrike landed a hell of a shot with his Anti-Material Rifle against the rainmaker. The enemy attempted to scurry out of the way, but was crushed like a bug.
- Shrike then took an even higher position, trained his aim on the sentinel, and broadcast an open message to the enemy: either surrender or be destroyed. Taking a moment to prevent his mech's reactor from melting down, the Sovereignty squad commander agreed to the terms and complied with Shrike's demand since his squad was down to just himself and the hive's pilot.
- With advice from Rio, CF marched the POWs with them along to FOB Saber, with Druzhina walking behind them on the ground, sword at the ready.

# FOB Saber
- As the sun set, CF finally arrived at the FOB, which turned out to be a repurposed automotive factory campus being run jointly by the LSA and Union.
- CF was immediately greeted by Staff Sergeant Omari Garcia. He said that due to the ongoing wide-area comms jamming, there was no way of knowing how many casualties have occurred for any side in this war, but it was known that there are still units of Union and LSA soldiers scattered around the city, unaccounted for.
- The Sovereignty POWs were processed accordingly and will be taken into a holding facility for questioning.
- Fortunately for the lancers, there is a schedule-1 printer available for use in the FOB. This is the only printer of its kind on Cressidium, as it was part of the demonstration for the technology Union is capable of providing for the world, should it agree to join. CF used it to fully repair their chassis, and also to manufacture new weapons and systems thanks to being granted an additional license.
- 1st. Lt. Kim also communicated to the folks running the printer that CF was authorized to push the printer to its limits and manufacture more experimental equipment (in the form of Exotic Gear). Thanks to CF's performance in the prior mission being as stellar as it was, they received more of this equipment than they otherwise would have.
- During this period of downtime, the members of CF also undertook various... "personal assignments," one might say. Through their cunning, charm, and hacking abilities, they were able to secure some additional, off-the-books equipment for use in the next mission.
