# Condition 1 - Azure
- A routine day aboard the *Rio Grande* was interrupted by **Rio** (the shipboard NHP) issuing an alert for all forces to prepare for deployment to Cressidium.
- In the briefing, **1st Lt. Kim** said that Vestan Sovereignty mechs are attacking the city of Nov Elysia, and **Ambassador Bannerjee** and **Captain Farris** are stranded. Strangely, comms are down.
- Mech squads were loaded in dropships for delivery to FOB Saber, an LSA base in Nov Elysia.

# It's Not the Fall that Kills You...
- During the descent, the ship ferrying Charlie Foxtrot squadron was struck by a powerful beam of light from the ground, causing it to crash. The origin of the beam is unknown at this time.
- CFâ€™s pilots and mechs survived without significant damage, but were quickly attacked by Sovereignty forces. They must hold out until they get a chance to continue moving through the city.
