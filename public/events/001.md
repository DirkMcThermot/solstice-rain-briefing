# Condition 1 - Azure
- A routine day aboard the *Rio Grande* was interrupted by **Rio** (the shipboard NHP) issuing an alert for all forces to prepare for deployment to Cressidium.
- In the briefing, **1st Lt. Kim** said that Vestan Sovereignty mechs are attacking the city of Nov Elysia, and **Ambassador Bannerjee** and **Captain Farris** are stranded. Strangely, comms are down.
- Mech squads were loaded in dropships for delivery to FOB Saber, an LSA base in Nov Elysia.

# It's Not the Fall that Kills You...
- During the descent, the ship ferrying Charlie Foxtrot squadron was struck by a powerful beam of light from the ground, causing it to crash. The origin of the beam is unknown at this time.
- CF’s pilots and mechs survived without significant damage, but were quickly attacked by Sovereignty forces.
- Fortunately, the squad was able to hold out after several close calls. They have performed light repairs and are ready to move out.

# On the Move in a Military Manner
- As CF made their way through the empty city streets, they came upon a broken-down bus of civilians, with LSA soldiers trying to get it moving again. After CF made it clear that they served Union, the LSA troops requested help from them.
- Their squad had been part of a larger group escorting civilians to emergency shelters, but became cut off in an ambush. The bus then broke down and left them stranded in the middle of the downtown area.
- CF naturally did what they could to help out, and were able to repair the bus and begin providing an escort thanks to their abilities to scavenge for the right parts, perform the repairs, and then scout a route forward.

# Look Both Ways
- A short while later, they came across a Sovereignty squad lying in wait for an ambush! CF had to get the bus safely through the battlefield and out of harm’s way ASAP.
- Fortunately, they were successful, with the bus itself sustaining only negligible impacts. Excellent work!

# Broken Sky
- After making it to a clear main road, the LSA troops and civilians went their separate way to the nearest emergency shelter, with a young girl leaving a stuffed toy rabbit with the squad for good luck.
- After some light repairs, CF went back on the move, eventually coming across a train depot housing a unit of Sovereignty mechs. One of them was a rainmaker-class frame loaded up with missiles, and it shot down a Union dropship as it flew overhead.
- This missile battery was not only in the squad’s way, but also interfering with future landings in the area.

# Downpour
- CF engaged the enemy from multiple angles, utilizing a side route provided by an LSA trooper from earlier.
- The skirmish is proving to be a challenging one for the squad. Oathkeeper has been destroyed, and the others aren’t looking so good. Hang in there, lancers!
